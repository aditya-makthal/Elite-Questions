At university of Chicago a Computer Science programing faculty as a part of 
teaching passion, in order to make newly joined students more enthusiastic 
in learning the subject he will be giving a problem at the first day of semester.

The student who tops they will be awarded with cash prize. In regard to this 
he asked the students to work on concept related to strings, he gave a task to
read a word and find the count of all the turn of phrases of the word, and 
the phrases should be distinct.

Now itâ€™s time for you to create a method which satisfies the above program.
A turn of phrases of a word is obtained by deleting 
any number of characters (possibly zero) from the front of the word and
any number of characters (possibly zero) from the back of the word.

Input Format:
-------------
A single string, the word.

Output Format:
--------------
Print an integer, number of distinct phrases possible.


Sample Input-1:
---------------
aabbaba

Sample Output-1:
----------------
21

Explanation:
-------------
The turn of phrases of the word, which are distinct as follows:
a, b, aa, bb, ab, ba, aab, abb, bab, bba, aba, aabb, abba, bbab, baba, 
aabba, abbab, bbaba, aabbab, abbaba, aabbaba


Sample Input-2:
---------------
kmithyd

Sample Output-2:
----------------
28
